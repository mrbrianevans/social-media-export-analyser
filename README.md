# `lib`
The `lib` directory contains javascript that can be run in the browser or on a server. 

This is the preferred location for code that doesn't require 
browser or node specific APIs.

# `data-vis-website-svelte`
This is the frontend website, written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). 
It runs completely in the browser, not sending any data to a server.

# Typescript
Wherever possible, Typescript is preferred in this project due to the better IDE support.
